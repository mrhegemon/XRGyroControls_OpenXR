# XRGyroControls_OpenXR

Before running anything in this repository, you will want to follow the instructions at https://gist.github.com/shinyquagsire23/3c68aecd872cc7ac21c28e950245dbd2 for setting up a *normal* Quest Link on macOS environment. This includes stuff like setting up MoltenVK.

Run `build_run.sh` to reset and then inject into the visionOS simulator. Run `build_inject.sh` to just inject into an existing instance.

Running list of brew dependencies I remember: `brew install gsed`

See `build.sh` for a list of my sins.
